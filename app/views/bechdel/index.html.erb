<h1>About Jacinda</h1>
Web development and computer science is such a broad and evolving field that I know my journey to becoming a better developer will always be filled with wonderful challenges. I think that is what’s so exciting about the field because there is so much to learn, and there is always something new to learn. Even at an environment like Launch Academy where we are learning many of the same concepts, everyday I hear about other cool gems that people have tried, or a fun problem they solved using a new algorithm. It’s been a challenge to realize that given a limited amount of time, it’s ok not to learn everything at once, because this journey of learning will continue for many, many years to come. I learned it’s important to prioritize what you want to learn today, or in the next week or month, and that what you are learning is helping you reach your goals, both short term and long term. As long as you work hard and remain diligent, you can go far!

Prior to Launch Academy I was working in a variety of marketing, communications, and data management positions. These ranged from a small management consulting firm doing both client work and marketing work, to print (using InDesign) and email communications in higher education, to development and communications at an arts nonprofit. In each of my jobs I worked on email marketing campaigns, and was able to refine my HTML, CSS, and design skills. I also worked heavily with a CRM in my previous role, and really enjoyed working with data, managing it, and building our system to adapt to the organization’s needs. This led me to programming, since I was inspired to build a system myself!

<h1>About the Bechdel Test</h1>
<p>
  The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria: (1) it has to have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other, about (3) something besides a man. The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule.

<h2>From Wikipedia:</h2>

<p>
The Bechdel test asks if a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added. Many contemporary works fail this test of gender bias. On average, films that pass the test have been found to have a lower budget than others, but have comparable or better financial performance.

<p>
The test is named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel. In 1985, she had a character in her comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For voice the idea, which she attributed to a friend, Liz Wallace. The test was originally conceived for evaluating films but has since been applied to other media. It is also known as the Bechdel/Wallace test, the Bechdel rule, Bechdel's law, or the Mo Movie Measure.
